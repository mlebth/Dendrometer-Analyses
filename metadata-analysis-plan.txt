Dataset names: dendrometer-data.csv: original data
	       dendrometer-data-corrected.csv: monthly growth corrected--monthly average
						taken where more than one month elapsed
						between measurements (2015 only)

Variables:
treeid [num]            = individual tree id 
spnum [num]             = forestry species code 
spname [char]           = tree common name 
spcode [char]           = 4-letter USDA species code 
site [char]             = FTIG site code (B6B, B10B, C03x [x added for consistency of variable length]) 
aspect [char]           = south (S) or north (N)--this is associated with site, not individual
sitequal [num]          = site quality (1: , 2: , 3: ).--this is associated with the individual tree, not the site
timbersale [char]       = Y (thinned ) or N (unthinned) 
dominance [char]        = dominant (D), co-dominant (C), or intermediate (I) 
baselinedbh [num]       = DBH at date of first installation (in inches) 
tension [char]          = lo, hi or na -- densiometer tension. only available for trees 1-24 (24-32: na) 
jun15mm-oct17mm [num]   = growth in mm of trees from previous month's measurement* 
tot15mm-tot17mm [num]   = total growth in mm of each tree from April-October* 
jun15rain-oct17rain [num] = total precipitation (inches) in previous month. If more than one month passed
			  between measurements, the value was divided by the number of intervening
			  months for a monthly average. Only in dataset when there is also a measurement.
jun15temp-oct17temp	= average high temperature (F) in the previous month(s). Only in dataset when there is also a measurement.
tot15rain-tot17rain	= total rainfall from initial band placement to last measurement
tot15temp-tot17temp	= average high temperature from initial band placement to last measurement
*for measurements: in dataset as '999' if value is missing


Analysis plan:
--descriptive stats first: simple visualizations of growth over time,
	proc freq of number of trees of each sp in each site/sitequal/timbersale/dominance

--total growth each year ~ spcode aspect sitequal timbersale dominance tension prevmonthmm prevmonthrain prevmonthtemp | site
--growth each month      ~ spcode aspect sitequal timbersale dominance tension prevmonthmm prevmonthrain prevmonthtemp | site
can also run by spcode (separate analyses for each sp)
****site may or may not be able to be used as a random variable--in some month-year combinations
there are only 2 sites represented; at most there are 3. ALSO, if doing this by species
then there are going to be generally only 2 observations per site-month-year.

tim wants 3 things: 
1) does timbersale make a difference (t-tests)
2) do other variables make a difference (anovas)
3) do months differ significantly from one another (anovas)
